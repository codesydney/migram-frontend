# Project MIGRAM (Migrant Marketplace)
# A. Lean Canvas
## 1. Project Background
IMS approached Code.Sydney early 2021 to consider building a marketplace app to help migrants of refugee background to get involved in the local community by offering low-skilled work under the supervision of IMS.  

## 2. Customer Segments
* Service Providers will be mainly migrants of refugee background. 
* End customers will be the local community around Wollongong and surrounds. 
* Estimated customer size for both segments is quite low at the start, most likely less than 30. 

## 3. Problem Statement
Many migrants of refugee background are having difficulty integrating to the society. Apart from language barriers, the local community needs to be more embracing of them being part of the local community.  

## 4. Solution 
One area to engage local community to help migrants of refugee background to integrate to the society is by introducing a marketplace app. IMS perceives the benefit of the app is two-fold, to get migrants of refugee background get involved in the community more and at the same time giving them some source of livelihood.  

## 5. Key Metrics

### Growth metrics
* No. of Customer Signups 
* % Customer Signup to First Task conversion

### Ongoing marketplace health metrics
* No. of Tasks per provider (ensuring an even spread of tasks)
* % Task assignment rate (% of tasks that get offers) 
* % Task fulfillment rate (% of tasks requested that end up getting completed) 
* % Customer Retention (% of customers that end up using Migram more than once) 
* % Provider Retention (% of providers that end up using Migram more than once) 

## 6. Unique Value Proposition 
* Unlike larger task marketplaces like Airtasker which has a provider service fee of 10-20% ([link here](https://support.airtasker.com/hc/en-au/articles/200294499-What-is-the-service-fee)), Migram does not charge a service fee to providers. 

* This maximises provider earnings, while also incentivising customers to support the local migrant community, knowing every $ they put in goes straight to the providers. 

## 7. Unfair Advantage 
* Unlike other apps which are mostly self-served, Migram will be a supervised app meaning there will be some sort of handholding by IMS to ensure the benefit of the app is realised.  

## 8. Marketing Channels
* Local marketing (local community board, mail marketing, etc) 
* Digital marketing (social media, etc)

## 9. Cost Structure 
* Frontend hosting fee - Vercel ($5/month)
* Backend hosting fee - Heroku ($9/month)
* Cloudinary (Free tier)
* EmailJS (Free tier)

## 10. Revenue Streams
* TBA with IMS 

## 11. User Acceptance Testing
We want to ensure that the app fits IMS's needs, as outlined in [Summary of Beta Version Success Criteria](#beta-success). User Acceptance Testing methodology TBD with IMS, but can come in the form of any of the following:

* **Lower involvement:** Code.Sydney sends IMS a list of UAT success criteria, and IMS fills it out before a set date. IMS can attend weekly meetings with Code.Sydney to discuss feedback
* **Higher involvement:** Live user interviews where an IMS rep goes through the features as facilitated by Code.Sydney, and we discuss live

Timelines:
* 31st Jan - Delivery of UAT version to IMS
* 20th Feb - UAT Success Criteria Definition
* 24th Feb - UAT Handover meeting
* 17th Mar - UAT Conclusion
* 1st Apr  - Soft Launch

UAT Success Criteria per User Persona:
Note - we have split each UAT Criteria into a Github Issue [here](https://github.com/codesydney/migram-frontend/issues?q=is%3Aopen+label%3A%22uat+%3Atest_tube%3A%22+sort%3Acreated-asc)
<br/>
You can also watch the demo videos of the end-to-end process [here](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLrmj6oeKMLjHK_njjssfFAZ4ZuzY6bko_)

## 12. Pre-production deployment
* Identify roles/responsibilities of IMS as well Code.Sydney support team in terms operations  
* Infrastructure is already set up (stripe/hosting/domain/etc)
* Agreement of both parties to go live (i.e. soft launch) 
* Stripe admin portal (provision of training by Praveen) 
* Handling of customer issues, application issues. Ensure proper escalation channel/process is defined depending on the case type (either tech/process). Note: The team to confirm if additional feature is needed in the future.    

## 13. Production deployment (Soft launch)
Date | Who | What | Status |
|:--|:--|:--|:--|
9-10 July 2022 | Engramar | Prepare high level presentation for app users | To do |
11-17 July 2022 | Engramar/Sam/Moises | Finalise Stage 1 version  | To do |
18-24 July 2022 | Engramar/Sam/Moises | Onboard service providers and do dry run using controlled customers | To do |
25-31 July 2022 | Engramar/Sam/Moises | Onboard first paying customers | To do |

## 14. Production deployment (Actual launch)
* Go Live (Standby support requirement?)

## 15. Post Production Activities
* After Go Live catch up (i.e. regular meeting schedule?)
* Backend monitoring and potential reporting by Code.Sydney (Paolo is interested to take this onboard)
* Support service requests handling
* User interviews (feedback)
* Future enhancements (app/processes)
